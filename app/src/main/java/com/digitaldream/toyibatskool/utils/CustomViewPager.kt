     * @author ToochiDennis
     * We start by initializing the height variable to 0.
     * We iterate over all the child views of the ViewPager using a for loop.
     * For each child view, we measure its height by calling
     * child.measure(widthMeasureSpec, MeasureSpec.makeMeasureSpec(0, MeasureSpec.UNSPECIFIED)).
     * This tells the child to measure its width based on the parent's widthMeasureSpec,
     * but to leave its height unconstrained (i.e., MeasureSpec.UNSPECIFIED).
     * We get the measured height of the child by calling child.measuredHeight.
     *If the height of the child is greater than the current value of height, we update height to the child's height.
     * Once we've measured all the child views, we create a new heightMeasureSpec with the maximum height by calling
     * MeasureSpec.makeMeasureSpec(height, MeasureSpec.EXACTLY).
     * Finally, we call super.onMeasure(widthMeasureSpec, newHeightMeasureSpec)
     * to set the ViewPager's dimensions based on the widthMeasureSpec
     * and the newHeightMeasureSpec we just created.
